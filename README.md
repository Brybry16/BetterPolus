## Technology
The game is patched at runtime via **[BepInEx Bleeding Edge](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx)** and no game file is actually altered.

For the moment, this mod supports **Among Us v2022.10.25**.

## Installation
For a better experience, every player in your lobby should download BetterPolus. You *can* play with people that don't have the mod installed but keep in mind that they won't see the same things as you (for example Vitals location).

There are two ways to install the mod :
- **All-in-one pack _(Easiest)_:** The easiest way to install BetterPolus.
- **Custom install _(Advanced/Recommended)_:** Download and install everything by yourself.

### All-in-one pack
1. Download the pack for your game version in the **[Releases section](#releases)** below.
2. Extract the content of the zip file into your game folder (**`Steam/steamapps/common/Among Us`**).
3. Run the game. The mod should be installed and it should work.

### Custom install
1. Download the latest build of BepInEx Bleeding Edge **[on this page](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be)** (select `BepInEx Unity (IL2CPP) for Windows (x86) games`).
2. Unzip the file in your Among Us directory and run the game once. Close the game once you see the title screen.
3. Download the **dll file** for your game version in the **[Releases section](#releases)** below.
4. Copy the dll file into **`Among Us/BepInEx/plugins`**.
5. Run the game. The mod should be installed and it should work.

 ## Uninstall

## Q&A
**How do I know if BetterPolus is correctly installed?**<br>
Just check that there is a line saying that BetterPolus has been loaded in the bottom left of the main menu.

**Does this works with (Better-)CrewLink (Proximity Chat)?**<br>
Of course!

**Do I risk anything if I play on official Servers?**<br>
There is currently no permaban system for the game so it's safe to play on official servers. However, I still recommend you to host your own custom server to be safe. For more information, you can check this repository :
- **[Impostor/Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor):** A custom server that allows you to create your own plugins.

**Can you use BetterPolus with Woodi's Sheriff Mod?**<br>
As of version 1.1.4, you you can use Woodi's Sheriff Mod!<br>
~~Reactor doesn't support Woodi's Sheriff Mod. **However**, you can use [**Reactor-Sheriff**](https://github.com/Brybry16/Reactor-Sheriff) which is an adapted version of Woodi's Sheriff Mod that can run with and BetterPolus.~~

**How can I get started at Among Us Modding?**<br>
Try to look how other plugins/mods are developed. It's really helpful to have a base to start with! Otherwise, you can try to use Reactor if you want. Look at the **[Reactor documentation](https://docs.reactor.gg/)** to get started, and join **[Reactor's Discord](https://discord.gg/Zcmsb9UGuq)** to get more help from the community.
