An Among Us mod that tweaks Polus, allowing a more balanced experience.

## Features
- **Vitals** have been moved to **Laboratory**.
- The **Reboot Wifi task** is now located in the **Dropship**.
- The **Chart Course** task is now located in **Comms**.
- The **Vents** near both Reactor Pods are **not linked to each other** anymore.
   - The Vent on **top of Electrical** is linked to the Vent on **top of Security**.
   - The Vent **outside of Laboratory** is linked to the Vent **inside Storage**.

## Technology
This mod has been created using **[Reactor Modding Framework](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor)**. The game is patched at runtime via **[Reactor BepInEx](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/BepInEx)** and no game file is actually altered.

For the moment, this mod supports **Among Us v2020.12.9s** *(Steam version)*.

## Installation
For a better experience, every player in your lobby should download BetterPolus. You *can* play with people that don't have the mod installed but keep in mind that they won't see the same things as you (for example Vitals location).

There are two ways to install the mod :

## Q&A
**How do I know if BetterPolus is correctly installed?**<br>
Just check that there is a line saying that BetterPolus has been loaded in the top left of the main menu.

**Does this works with (Better-)CrewLink (Proximity Chat)?**<br>
Of course!

**Do I risk anything if I play on official Servers?**<br>
There is currently no permaban system for the game so it's safe to play on official servers. However, I still recommend you to host your own custom server to be safe. For more information, you can check these repositories :
- **[Impostor/Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor):** A custom server that allows you to create your own plugins.
- **[NuclearPowered/Impostor](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Impostor):** Impostor but maintained by the team behind Reactor. <ins>Use this if you want to play with plugins that need Reactor's Custom RPC API or Modded Handshake.</ins>

**Can you use BetterPolus with Woodi's Sheriff Mod?**<br>
Reactor doesn't support Woodi's Sheriff Mod. **However**, you can use [**Reactor-Sheriff**](https://github.com/Brybry16/Reactor-Sheriff) which is an adapted version of Woodi's Sheriff Mod that can run with and BetterPolus.

**How can I get started at Among Us Modding?**<br>
Look at the **[Reactor documentation](https://docs.reactor.gg/)** to get started, and join **[Reactor's Discord](https://discord.gg/Zcmsb9UGuq)** to get more help from the community.
