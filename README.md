## Technology
This mod has been created using **[Reactor Modding Framework](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor)**. The game is patched at runtime via **[Reactor BepInEx](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/BepInEx)** and no game file is actually altered.

For the moment, this mod supports **Among Us v2020.12.9s** *(Steam version)*.

## Installation
For a better experience, every player in your lobby should download BetterPolus. You *can* play with people that don't have the mod installed but keep in mind that they won't see the same things as you (for example Vitals location).

There are two ways to install the mod :
- **All-in-one pack _(Easiest)_:** The easiest way to install BetterPolus.
- **Custom install _(Advanced/Recommended)_:** Download and install everything by yourself.

### All-in-one pack
1. Download the pack for your game version in the **[Releases section](#releases)** below.
2. Extract the content of the zip file into your game folder (**`Steam/steamapps/common/Among Us`**).
3. Run the game from Steam.

### Custom install
1. Install Reactor BepInEx by following **[these instructions](https://docs.reactor.gg/docs/basic/install_bepinex/)**.
2. Install Reactor by following **[these instructions](https://docs.reactor.gg/docs/basic/install_reactor)**.
3. Download the **dll file** for your game version in the **[Releases section](#releases)** below.
4. Copy the dll file into **`Among Us/BepInEx/plugins`**.
5. (Optional) If you want to play on official servers, you must do the following (**doesn't work anymore since v2021.3.31s**) :
    - Open **`Among us/BepInEx/config/gg.reactor.api.cfg`** with a text editor.
    - Find the line `Modded handshake = true` and change it to `Modded handshake = false`.
    - Save and close your editor.

## Q&A
**How do I know if BetterPolus is correctly installed?**<br>
Just check that there is a line saying that BetterPolus has been loaded in the top left of the main menu.

**Does this works with (Better-)CrewLink (Proximity Chat)?**<br>
Of course!

**Do I risk anything if I play on official Servers?**<br>
There is currently no permaban system for the game so it's safe to play on official servers. However, I still recommend you to host your own custom server to be safe. For more information, you can check these repositories :
- **[Impostor/Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor):** A custom server that allows you to create your own plugins.
- **[NuclearPowered/Impostor](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Impostor):** Impostor but maintained by the team behind Reactor. <ins>Use this if you want to play with plugins that need Reactor's Custom RPC API or Modded Handshake.</ins>

**Can you use BetterPolus with Woodi's Sheriff Mod?**<br>
Reactor doesn't support Woodi's Sheriff Mod. **However**, you can use [**Reactor-Sheriff**](https://github.com/Brybry16/Reactor-Sheriff) which is an adapted version of Woodi's Sheriff Mod that can run with and BetterPolus.

**How can I get started at Among Us Modding?**<br>
Look at the **[Reactor documentation](https://docs.reactor.gg/)** to get started, and join **[Reactor's Discord](https://discord.gg/Zcmsb9UGuq)** to get more help from the community.
